5. Numbers -- print consecutive numbers
Write a function:
that, given a positive integer N, prints the consecutive numbers from 1 to N,
each on a separate line. However, any number divisible by 2, 3 or 5 should
be replaced by the word Codility, Test or Coders respectively. If a number
is divisible by more than one of the numbers: 2,3 or 5, it should be replaced
by a concatenation of the respective words Codility, Test and Coders in this
given order. For example, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 should be
replacÃ©e by CodilityTest and numbers divisible by all three numbers: 2,3
and 5, should be replaced by CodilityTestCoders.

For example, here is the output for N = 24:
1
Codility
Test
Codility
Coders
CodilityTest
7
Codility
Test
Codi1ityCoders
11
CodilityTest
13
Codility
TestCoders
Codility
17
