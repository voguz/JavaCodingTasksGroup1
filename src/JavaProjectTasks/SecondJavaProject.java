        Number - Divisible by 3,5,15
        Write a program that can print the numbers between 1 ~ 100 that can be
        divisible by 3, 5, and 15.
        if the number can be divisible by 3, 5 and 15, then it should only be
        displayed in Divisible By 15 section
        if the number can be divisible by 3 but cannot be divisible by 15, then it
        should only be displayed in Divisible By 3 section
        if the number can be divisible by 5 but cannot be divisible by 15, then it
        should only be displayed in Divisible By 5 section
        ex:
        OutPut:
        Divisible By 15 15 30 45 60 75 90
        Divisible By 5 5 10 20 25 35 40 50 55 65 70 80 85 95 100
        Divisible By 3 3 6 9 12 18 21 24 27 33 36 39 42 48 51 54 57 63 66 69 72

        Numbers - print consecutive numbers
        Write a function:
        that, given a positive integer N, prints the consecutive numbers from 1 to N,
        each on a separate line. However, any number divisible by 2, 3 or 5 should
        be replaced by the word Codility, Test or Coders respectively. If a number
        is divisible by more than one of the numbers: 2,3 or 5, it should be replaced
        by a concatenation of the respective words Codility, Test and Coders in this
        given order. For example, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 should be
        replaced by Codility Test and numbers divisible by all three numbers: 2,3
        and 5, should be replaced by Codility TestCoders.
        For example, here is the output for N = 24:
         1
         Codility
         Test
         Codility
         Coders
